package LinkedList;

public class Note {
    // A linked list consists of a data element known as a node. 
    
    //Linked list Big O

    /*
so Linked list:Constructor
Public Linkedlist(int value) {..}  , this created a new node

Public void append (int value) {..}
this also creates a new node and then add the node to the end

Public void prepend (int values) {..}
this also creates a new node and then add the node to the beginning

Public boolean insert ( int index, int value) {..}
this also creates a new node and then adds the not at a particular index

, as we can see all ths crates a node , inssted of creating node everything thime , we can jsut do (class Node{
} )  so whenever thoes 4 wants to created a node it will just call the classnode

A node looks like this, 4>null or{
                                        "Value" = 4,
                                        "next" = null
                                        }



Type node just means they can point to a node
